    # Helper for extracting solidus_frontend from solidus meta-gem
    #
    # We're recommending users use newer solidus_starter_frontend. However,
    # we're still shipping solidus_frontend as part of the solidus meta-gem. The
    # reason is that we don't want users updating previous versions to see its
    # storefront gone suddenly.
    #
    # In future solidus releases, solidus_frontend won't be a component anymore.
    # However, until that happens:
    #
    # - For users of the new frontend, we need to prevent pulling
    # solidus_frontend.
    # - For users of the legacy frontend, we need to prevent Bundler from
    # resolving it from the mono-repo while it's still there.
    #
    # This class is a needed companion during the deprecation
    # path. It'll modify the user's Gemfile, breaking the solidus gem down into
    # its components but solidus_frontend.
